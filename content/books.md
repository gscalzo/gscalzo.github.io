It all started when I was watching WWDC 2014 at NSLondon.
Apple presented Swift and I was shocked.

That night, I converted a clone of Flappy Bird I had made into Swift.
I tweeted it, and after a few weeks, I was invited to present it, along with the rest of the language, to a new meetup group just created: 'Swift London.'

The presentation was a success, and somehow a representative of Packt Publishing contacted me to write a book about Swift.
I was shocked again, since I was sure I couldn't write a book.
However, I said to myself, 'Let's give it a try, at least for a chapter.'

And this resulted in six published books!
