Last Monday after seeing this amazing WWDC 14 with the friends of NSLondon, I was so excited to trying this new language that, when I saw this tweet, I thought was the perfect way to test drive Swift.

At around Midnight, when finally I had Xcode 6 installed, I selected “New Project” and I started to convert a FlappyBird clone I did few months ago.

After a couple of hours, at around 2AM, when I was pretty satisfied, I pushed the [code to Github](https://github.com/gscalzo/FlappySwift), replied to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/giordanoscalzo/status/473626592363945985) then I went do sleep.   

When I woke up, I checked my emails and I was very happy seeing that more than 100 people had starred my little project; but few hours later I noticed that another guy had had the same idea (and the [same project name](https://github.com/fullstackio/FlappySwift)), but in contrast with mine, his was with more the 1000 stars!

Ok, to be fair his version had also pipes, and the README was prettier, but that wouldn’t have been enough to explain such success.Yep, the answer was simple: that guy, instead tweeting it only, put the link in HackerNews, where quickly had had reached the first page.

To wrap up, it doesn’t matter if you are quick, it doesn’t matter if you are good… it needs it, but it’s not enough: it’s the way you present your product and how you communicate it that matters in the end :-)
