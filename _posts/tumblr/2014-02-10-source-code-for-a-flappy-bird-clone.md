FlappyBirdClone
A Sprite Kit Sloppy Flappy Bird Clone
While the whole world went crazy with a quite boring, but temendously difficult game, I was busy studying Functional Programming an iOS. Just the day before the author pulled it down from the store, I downloaded it and after a couple of games, I wondered how much time I would had need to create a simple clone using Sprite Kit. So, I waited mi kids went to bed and I created a new project with AppCode…
Ok, first implementation done! Not perfect, code is definitely bad, but for a few hours project is good! The app is still in progress, next step clean a bit the code and add sensor to count the number of pipes passed.
Here it is the code:
