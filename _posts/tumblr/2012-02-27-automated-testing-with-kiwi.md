Automated Testing with Kiwi Tdd in iPhone still seems some sort of black magic, a well kept secret in the hands of some obscure guild of caped developers.
The reality is that almost nobody is doing Tdd in iPhone dev, because of several reasons.
One of them is that the test engines are quite primordial, compared to Ruby o Java ones.
But Kiwi  is a different one, and Tdd is fun again!
