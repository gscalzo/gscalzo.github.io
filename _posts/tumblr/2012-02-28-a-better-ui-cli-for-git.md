A Better UI (CLI) for gitI love programming in Ruby or Python, because the way to do something is almost always the obvious one.
I can’t say the same for git, where too often I’m struggling with its counterintuitive commands, trying to remember is model and find the way to do my things.
But, generally, it’s a names matter, so with a couple of aliases, git becomes an obedient butler.
