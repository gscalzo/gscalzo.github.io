Adding Core Data Existing iPhone Projects I admit, CoreData still doesn’t buy me, anyway it’s the better way to store complex data on iPhone.
Sadly, too often I decide to use it after the project is started, so I can’t exploit the XCode project templates.
Anyway, add CoreData later isn’t such a big deal, just manually add a model file and a bunch of code to create the managers.
